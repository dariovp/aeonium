# Project Aeonium

![Aeonium, the tree houseleeks](./docs/assets/aeonium.webp)

### Summary

Project Aeonium is a client that allows the addition, modification, and deletion of users and their data in a remote server. It acts as an admin panel that has full-access to the social graph.

It requires a basic express server with data stored in json format (this project does not use any database engine due to being out of focus)

### Objectives

The objective of this project is to showcase a working end-to-end React application with create, read, update and delete functionality.

### How to run (WIP)



### Spec

Check the [client documentation]() and [server documentation]() for implementation details.
